### Eduardo's modifications

This repository also includes my (Eduardo's) modifications to the
`abcg` framework, developed as projects during the course.

Currently, you can find the following projects in the `examples` folder:

- *GL-Ball*: A simple Arkanoid clone, with some influences from the
  `DX-Ball` DOS game and the `One More Brick` mobile game. [live demo](https://renesto.space/courses/cg/gl-ball.html) [report](./reports/a1.gl-ball.pdf)
  
### Reports

The above modifications have corresponding written reports, explaining
their development. They are written in Markdown + LaTeX, and converted
to PDF using Pandoc. Both the sources and the resulting PDF files can be
found in the `reports` folder.
